solution level09:

> ls -l
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag09  level09 7640 Mar  5  2016 level09
----r--r-- 1 flag09  level09   26 Mar  5  2016 token

> cat token
f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��

it seems the token has been modified, in any way it does not work when we try to log as user flag09

-> we examine the executable so as to understand its behaviour

> ./level09
"You need to provied only one arg."

> ./level09 "toto"
"tpvr"

> ./level09 "abcdef"
"acegik"

we can see a pattern : a => a (+0), b => c (+1), c => e (+2), d => g (+3) etc.
it seems the algorithm simply adds to each character the value of its index in the string

-> we make the smart guess that the token we have has been through the algorithm already

besides if we use ltrace we get a clue:
> ltrace ./level09 token
...
puts("You should not reverse this"You should not reverse this
...

-> we will create a simple C script, whose behaviour is the reverse of the algorithm

> gcc rev.c -o rev

-> we run the script on the token and get the password for user flag09

> scp -P 2222 level09@127.0.0.1:~/token .; chmod 755 token
> ./rev `cat token`
"f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq"

> su flag09

> getflag

Check flag.Here is your token : s5cAJpM8ev6XHw998pRWG728z
